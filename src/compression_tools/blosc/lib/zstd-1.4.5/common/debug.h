/*
 * The purpose of this header is to enable debug functions.
 * They regroup assert(), DEBUGLOG() and RAWLOG() for run-time,
 * and DEBUG_STATIC_ASSERT() for compile-time.
 *
 * By default, DEBUGLEVEL==0, which means run-time debug is disabled.
 *
 * Level 1 enables assert() only.
 * Starting level 2, traces can be generated and pushed to stderr.
 * The higher the level, the more verbose the traces.
 *
 * It's possible to dynamically adjust level using variable g_debug_level,
 * which is only declared if DEBUGLEVEL>=2,
 * and is a global variable, not multi-thread protected (use with care)

/* recommended values for DEBUGLEVEL :
 * 0 : release mode, no debug, all run-time checks disabled
 * 1 : enables assert() only, no display
 * 2 : reserved, for currently active debug path
 * 3 : events once per object lifetime (CCtx, CDict, etc.)
 * 4 : events once per frame
 * 5 : events once per block
 * 6 : events once per sequence (verbose)
 * 7+: events at every position (*very* verbose)
 *
 * It's generally inconvenient to output traces > 5.
 * In which case, it's possible to selectively trigger high verbosity levels
 * by modifying g_debug_level.
